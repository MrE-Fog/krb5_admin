.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_admind.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr krb5_admind 8
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for
.Xr krb5_admind 8 .
The syntax is a Perl snippet which is evaluated and is expected to
set the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width %win_xrealm_bootstrapx
.It Ar $allow_fetch
is a boolean value which indicates whether
.Xr krb5_admind 8
is willing to allow clients to directly fetch keys from the Kerberos
database.
Setting this to true may be necessary at some sites but is generally
discouraged as it reduces certain security guarantees.
Also see
.Xr krb5_keytab 8 Ns 's
configuration variable
.Ar $use_fetch .
This value defaults to false.
.It Ar %xrealm_bootstrap
is a hash which has keys that are Kerberos realms with values that are
an array ref of Kerberos realms.
If a host authenticates to
.Xr krb5_admind 8
with a host principal in the key's realm then it will be authenticated
to retrieve Kerberos host principals with a matching hostname in any of
the realms listed in the value.
E.g.
.Bd -literal
	%xrealm_bootstrap = (
		'REALM1'  => ['REALM2', 'REALM3'],
	);
.Ed
.Pp
means that
.Ar host/foo@REALM1
can retrieve keys for
.Ar host/foo@REALM2
and
.Ar host/foo@REALM3 .
.It Ar %win_xrealm_bootstrap
is a hash that maps a Windows principal to a list of host principals which
it may retrieve.
The Windows principal's components must be lower case.
This hash can be used when migrating from using Windows Active Directory
to provide Kerberos for UNIX hosts to a strictly UNIX KDC framework.
.It Ar %prestash_xrealm
is a hash that maps a principal's realm to a list of realms on which the
principal is allowed to be prestashed.
E.g.
.Bd -literal
	%prestash_xrealm = (
		'REALM1' => ['REALM2', 'REALM3'],
	);
.Ed
.Pp
means that principals in REALM1 may be prestashed on hosts that are in
REALM2 or REALM3.
.El
.Pp
Syntax errors will terminate parsing causing all subsequent configuration
to be ignored and so it is critical that they not be present.
