.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_admin
.Nd kerberos administration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Mdlv
.Op Fl D Ar kdb
.Op Fl S Ar sqlitedb
.Op Fl h Ar hostspec
.Op Fl r Ar REALM
.Ar command Ar arg Oo Ar arg ... Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to make modifications to the Kerberos database, either remotely
via the
.Xr krb5_admind 8
daemon, or locally (with the
.Fl l
flag.)
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indentxxxxxx
.It Fl D Ar kdb
specifies the location of the Kerberos DB when running against a local
database.
Defaults to the location built into the Kerberos libriares.
Implies
.Fl l .
.It Fl M
connect to the master KDC rather than a slave.
.It Fl S Ar sqlitedb
specifies the location of the sqlite3 adjunct database where
.Nm
stores its additional schemas.
Can only be used if running against a local database.
.It Fl d
print debugging output.
.It Fl h Ar hostspec
connect to
.Ar hostspec
instead of searching for KDCs using the usual method.
A
.Ar hostspec
has a format of
.Oo Ar service@ Oc Ns Ar hostname Ns Oo : Ns Ar port Oc .
.It Fl r Ar REALM
connect to one of the KDCs for realm
.Ar REALM .
.It Fl l
operate on the local Kerberos DB.
.It Fl v
make the output a bit more verbose.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar command
is provided on the command line,
.Nm
will prompt for commands to process.
.Pq This behaviour is deprecated as the quoting is sub-optimal.
.Pp
The remaining arguments to
.Nm
are accepted from the shell and no further quoting is performed.
The first argument is considered to be the command and the remaining
arguments are passed to the command.
Some commands accept a list of key value pairs starting after a
particular position.
Some keys are denoted as ``set-based'' meaning that they manage a
set of values rather than an individual setting.
Set-based keys take a comma-separated list of values
.Pq interpreted as a set
and can also
take plus equals
.Pq +=
or minus equals
.Pq -=
to add or subtract elements from the set.
.Pp
Authorisation to make a change is checked both before and after any action.
If the owernsip is changed such that the actor may not revert the change,
then the change is not allowed.
This means that you cannot relinquish access to any of the objects that
.Nm
manages.
This has the nice property that the user can always undo any action
that they just performed.
The downside is that transferring ownership becomes a two step
process where the original owner adds a new owner and then the new
owner removes the old owner.
.Pp
General commands:
.Bl -ohang -offset ind
.It Ar master
outputs the name of the master KDC.
.El
.Pp
Commands that operate on principals:
.Pp
.Bl -ohang -offset ind
.It Ar list Op Ar glob
will list the principals that match the
.Ar glob .
.It Ar query Ar princ
will display the principal
.Ar princ .
.It Ar mquery Ar glob Op Ar glob Ar ...
Outputs a list of principals.
.It Ar remove Ar princ
will remove the principal
.Ar princ .
.It Ar enable Ar princ
will enable the principal
.Ar princ
by removing the attribute
.Fl allow_tix .
.It Ar disable Ar princ
will disable the principal
.Ar princ
by adding the attribute
.Fl allow_tix .
.It Ar create_appid Ar princ Op Ar key=val ...
will create a principal for use by automated processes.
This principal will have no assigned passwd and will have a default
owner set to the calling user.
The key value pairs are the same as for
.Ar modify .
.It Ar create_user Ar princ
will create a principal with a random temporary password which is printed
to stdout. The password must be reset by the user via
.Xr kpasswd 1 .
.It Ar reset_password Ar princ
will reset the password of a principal to a random temporary password
which is printed to stdout. The password must be reset by the user via
.Xr kpasswd 1 .
.It Ar modify Ar princ Oo Ar key=val ... Oc
will modify a principal or its associated attributes.
The following keys are defined for all principals: princ_expire_time,
pw_expiration, max_life, max_renewable_life, and attributes.
The following keys are defined for appids:
owner
.Pq set-based ,
desc,
cstraint
.Pq set-based .
.El
.Pp
Commands that operate on policies:
.Bl -ohang -offset ind
.It Ar listpols Op Ar glob
will list the policies that match
.Ar glob .
.El
.Pp
Commands that operate on ``features'':
.Bl -ohang -offset ind
.It add_feature Ar feature
Adds a ``feature'' flag.
.It has_feature Ar feature
Check to see if ``feature'' is present, i.e. has been added.
.El
.Pp
Commands that operate on hosts:
.Pp
.Bl -ohang -offset ind
.It create_host Ar host No realm= Ns Ar REALM Op No key=val ...
Create a host in the krb5_admin database with the given realm and
bootbinding.
The realm is used for prestashed ticket access control and is a
required parameter.
The remaining key value pairs are the same as for
.Ar modify_host .
.It create_logical_host
Create a logical host.
This commands works the same as
.Ar create_host
except the host created is marked as a logical host which means that
it is either an alias to an existing host or a cluster of hosts.
.It bind_host Ar host Ar principal
Bind an existing host to the given ephemeral principal, this
entitles the host to negotiate its initial keys.
.It remove_host Ar host
Remove
.Ar host .
.It modify_host Ar host Op No key=val ...
will modify the attributes of a host.
The following keys are defined for all hosts: realm, ip_addr,
bootbinding, and owner
